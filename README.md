# Observer Pattern Study
[Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) is a programming pattern with intent defined by [Source Making](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/observer) as purposed to:
>Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

This project has implemented the pattern to handle a simple RPG battle system as inspired by [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/munificentbob)'s book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html).
